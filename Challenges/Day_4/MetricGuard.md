# Task2: Monitoring System's Metrics with Sleep Mechanism

## "MetricGuard" - Your System Metrics Protector!

Once the script starts, you'll see a simple menu displayed on the terminal:
  ```
   ---- Monitoring Metrics Script ----

   1. View System Metrics
   2. Monitor a Specific Service
   3. Exit
   ```

Depending on your choice of input, it'll print you the result

- If you choose option 1, the script will display the current system metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage.
- If you choose option 2, the script will prompt you to enter the name of the service you want to monitor. Let's say you want to monitor Nginx. Enter "nginx" when prompted:
- If you choose option 3, the script will gracefully exit, and the terminal prompt will be returned to you.
- In case of any errors, such as invalid input or failed commands, the script will display appropriate error messages. For example:

   ```
   Error: Invalid option. Please choose a valid option (1, 2, or 3).
   ```
