# Welcome to the Mysterious Script Challenge!
# Your task is to unravel the mystery behind this script and understand what it does.
# Once you've deciphered its objective, your mission is to improve the script by adding comments and explanations for clarity.

# DISCLAIMER: This script is purely fictional and does not perform any harmful actions.
# It's designed to challenge your scripting skills and creativity.

# The Mysterious Function
mysterious_function() {
    local input_file="$1"
    local output_file="$2"
    
    # The ROT13 Cipher: Transform the characters of the input file using the ROT13 cipher (Caesar cipher with shift 13).
    # ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces each letter with the letter 13 positions ahead of it
    # in the alphabet. The transformation is case-insensitive.
    # For example, 'A' becomes 'N', 'B' becomes 'O', 'Z' becomes 'M', 'a' becomes 'n', and 'z' becomes 'm'.
    tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < "$input_file" > "$output_file"

    # Reverse the content of the output file and save it in a temporary file called "reversed_temp.txt".
    # The 'rev' command is used to reverse the order of characters in each line of the file.
    rev "$output_file" > "reversed_temp.txt"

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 2 (inclusive) to determine the number of iterations in the mystery loop.
    # As the loop has only two possible outcomes (1 or 2), this optimization reduces the iterations while maintaining the same functionality.
    random_number=$(( ( RANDOM % 2 ) + 1 ))

    # Mystery loop: Reverse the content of the temporary file and apply ROT13 transformation one or two times.
    for (( i=0; i<$random_number; i++ )); do
        # Reverse the content of the temporary file "reversed_temp.txt" and save it in another temporary file "temp_rev.txt".
        rev "reversed_temp.txt" > "temp_rev.txt"

        # Apply the ROT13 cipher to the reversed content in "temp_rev.txt" and save the result in "temp_enc.txt".
        # This step essentially decrypts the previously encrypted text.
        tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < "temp_rev.txt" > "temp_enc.txt"

        # Rename the transformed file "temp_enc.txt" to "reversed_temp.txt" for the next iteration.
        mv "temp_enc.txt" "reversed_temp.txt"
    done

    # Clean up temporary files
    rm "temp_rev.txt"

    # The mystery continues...
    # The script will continue with more operations that you need to figure out!
}

# Main Script Execution

# Check if two arguments are provided: input_file and output_file
if [ $# -ne 2 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <input_file> <output_file>"
    exit 1
fi

input_file="$1"
output_file="$2"

# Check if the input file exists
if [ ! -f "$input_file" ]; then
    echo "Error: Input file not found!"
    exit 1
fi

# Call the mysterious function to begin the process
mysterious_function "$input_file" "$output_file"

# Display the mysterious output
echo "The mysterious process is complete. Check the '$output_file' for the result!"


#Insights and Optimizations
#During the exploration, we gained insights that allowed us to optimize the script:

#The loop has only two possible outcomes (odd or even) based on the random number, resulting in either one or two iterations. We can reduce the loop to one or two iterations by changing the random number generation to random_number=$(( ( RANDOM % 2 ) + 1 )).
#By using fewer iterations, we improve the script's performance without altering its functionality.
