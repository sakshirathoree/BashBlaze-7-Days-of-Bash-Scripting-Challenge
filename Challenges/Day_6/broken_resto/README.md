# Task 2: "Restaurant Order Script" 

# The Hungry Bash - Restaurant Order System Challenge

Welcome to "The Hungry Bash" challenge! üçîüçïü•óü•§

## Challenge Description

In this challenge, I successfully tackled the "Restaurant Order System" task, breathing life into a partially broken Bash script, `restaurant_order.sh`. This script, once fixed and completed, now provides a seamless dining experience for customers.

## The Broken Script

The `restaurant_order.sh` script had some missing components that I had to address:

1. **Missing Menu Display:** The script lacked the ability to read and display the menu from the `menu.txt` file. I implemented the `display_menu()` function to showcase the menu items and their prices, ensuring customers have a clear view of available options.

2. **Invalid User Input Handling:** The script wasn't equipped to handle invalid user input, such as non-existent item numbers or negative quantities. To enhance the user experience, I introduced the `handle_invalid_input()` function for graceful error handling.

3. **Total Bill Calculation:** The script struggled to calculate the correct total bill based on the customer's order. To overcome this, I devised the `calculate_total_bill()` function, meticulously computing the bill considering the order and menu prices.

## My Approach

1. **Display Menu:** Using the `awk` command, I skillfully extracted the menu information from `menu.txt` and formatted it to create an informative display for customers.

2. **Invalid Input Handling:** I crafted the `handle_invalid_input()` function to interact with users gracefully, prompting them for valid item numbers and quantities.

3. **Total Bill Calculation:** Leveraging the `calculate_total_bill()` function, I calculated the total bill by iteratively processing the order and menu prices, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

## Learnings & Insights

This challenge was a fantastic opportunity for learning and growth. I deepened my understanding of error handling, data manipulation, and menu display in Bash scripting. Debugging and problem-solving took center stage, further refining my scripting skills.

## Reflection

The challenge underscored the importance of meticulous scripting and attention to detail. It reinforced my enthusiasm for problem-solving and script development. The satisfaction of crafting a functional solution from a broken script is truly gratifying.
